# `verifySignature`

Verify a signature against a message and a public key.

## Types

```typescript
function verifySignature (data: SignMessageResponseData): Promise<boolean>

interface SignMessageResponseData {
  // The public key of the authenticated user
  pubkey: string
  /**
   * The challenge that was requested to be signed
   */
  challenge: string
  /**
   * The message that was signed by the authenticator,
   * Note that the message may not be the original raw message,
   * but is combined with client data and authenticator data
   * according to [WebAuthn Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-op-get-assertion).
   */
  message: string
  /**
   * The signature of the message that was signed by the authenticator
   */
  signature: string
  /**
   * key type of the authenticated user
   */
  keyType: 'main_key' | 'sub_key' | 'main_session_key' | 'sub_session_key'
  /**
   * Custom state that will be returned to your app after signing
   */
  state?: any

  /**
   * The algorithm of the signature.
   * corresponds to the `value` field of the [COSE](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#algorithms) structure
   */
  alg: number

  /**
   * The attestation of the signature,
   * only available when keyType is `main_session_key` or `sub_session_key`
   */
  attestation?: string
}
```

## Example

```js
import { signWithPopup, verifySignature } from '@joyid/core'

const { error, data } = await signWithPopup(request)
if (error == null) {
  const result = await verifySignature(data)
  alert(result) // true or false
}
```
