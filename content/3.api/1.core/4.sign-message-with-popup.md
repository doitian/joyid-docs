  isData?: boolean
  /**
   * Custom state that will be returned to your app after signing

}

interface SignMessageResponse {
  type: 'SignMessage'
  error?: string
  data?: SignMessageData
}

interface SignMessageData {
  // The public key of the authenticated user
  pubkey: string
  /**
   * The challenge that was requested to be signed
   */
  challenge: string
  /**
   * The message that was signed by the authenticator,
   * Note that the message may not be the original raw message,

  signature: string
  /**
   * key type of the authenticated user
   */
  keyType: 'main_key' | 'sub_key' | 'main_session_key' | 'sub_session_key'

  /**
   * The algorithm of the signature.
