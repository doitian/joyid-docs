# `signCallback`

Get signed data from JoyID app, this function needs to work with [`signWithRedirect`](/api/core/auth-with-redirect) to complete the signing.

## Types

```ts
function signCallback (): SignMessageResponse

interface SignMessageResponse {
  type: 'SignMessage'
  error?: string
  data?: SignMessageResponseData
}

interface SignMessageResponseData {
  // The JoyID of the authenticated user
  joyid: string
  // The CKB address of the authenticated user
  address: string
  // The public key of the authenticated user
  pubkey: string
  /**
   * The challenge that was requested to be signed
   */
  challenge: string
  /**
   * The message that was signed by the authenticator,
   * Note that the message is not the original raw message,
   * but is combined with client data and authenticator data
   * according to [WebAuthn Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-op-get-assertion).
   */
  message: string
  /**
   * The signature of the message that was signed by the authenticator
   */
  signature: string
  /**
   * key type of the authenticated user
   */
  keyType: 'main_key' | 'sub_key'
}
```

## Example

In order to redirect to JoyID app to sign message, We can start by declaring a sign component, which specify `redirectURL` to `/sign` path of the app.

```js
import { signWithRedirect } from '@joyid/core'
const MyLoginComponent = () => {
  function onClick() {
    const request = {
      // redirect to /sign
      redirectURL: 'https://example.com/sign',
      title: 'Example App',
      logo: 'https://example.com/logo.png',
      challenge: 'Sign this message',
    }
    signWithRedirect(request)
  }
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      Sign with JoyID
    </button>
  )
}
```

When the component with the `/login` path loads, we can call `authCallback` to get the redirected data from the JoyID App.

```js
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { signCallback } from '@joyid/core'
/* `/sign` page component */
const SignPageComponent = () => {
  const isRedirectFromJoyID = new URL(location.href).searchParams.has('joyid_redirect')
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isRedirectFromJoyID) {
      const res = signCallback()
      if (res.error != null) {
        console.error(res.error)
      } else {
        // the user has authenticated,
        // do something with res.data, it's type safe!
      }
    }
  }, [])

  return <MySignPageComponent />
}
```

## Details

Before `signCallback()` is called, you should validate the `joyid_redirect` query parameter in the URL, if it's not present, it means the user is not redirected from JoyID app.
